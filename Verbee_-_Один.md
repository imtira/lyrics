[I'm really not sure on this]
- Zheka, what happened?
- She didn't take her phone with her?
- Did they drive to rest?
- Just forget it.

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of you not picking up the phone
Tired of this talk that your parents are waiting for you
I'm tired of you sleeping when I call you
And I'm tired of yelling when I get through

[Pre-chorus]
Purapa-pa, purapa-pa!
And they said "You don't have faith in her"
Purapa-pa, purapa-pa!
And they talked, but I was convinced myself

[Chorus]
Now I'm alone, breathing out smoke
Mom, don't wait for me - your son is running away
Now I'm alone, breathing out smoke
Forever young. I'll be drunk and happy

Now I'm alone, breathing out smoke
Mom, don't wait for me - your son is running away
Now I'm alone, breathing out smoke
Just exhale - I will be forever young.

[Verse 2]
Hey! Well, what if it's very difficult for me?
What if I really need your support?
You call, but now I won't pick up the phone
Do you think I'll run to you? Sure...

They carry me out of the club, drunk
I don't know why I drank - alcohol is the devil's plaything
And your friends look at me wildly
They say it's not cool, but they envy me behind my back

[Pre-chorus]
Pura-pa, pura-pa!
I'll drink all day over of you.
Pura-pa, pura-papa!
They talked, and now I know for myself

[Chorus]
Now I'm alone, breathing out smoke
Mom, don't wait for me - your son is running away
Now I'm alone, breathing out smoke
Forever young. I'll be drunk and happy

Now I'm alone, breathing out smoke
Mom, don't wait for me - your son is running away
Now I'm alone, breathing out smoke
Just exhale - I will be forever young.
